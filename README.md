# summod
This is summod, a dominions 4 overhaul mod, and it is a work in progress.  For discussion: http://z7.invisionfree.com/Dom3mods/index.php?showtopic=2764 

The changelog starts on the next page, around line 15.  At the moment it is more readable in "raw" or here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10xPz7ZKUhR3avOCwbAr7XKdt5wMmJbEm4J-WNHyQ160/edit#heading=h.dztyhnmwhhzn

Thanks to:      Lambert_S, Ohlmann, Amuys, Johannes, Algulod, llamabeast, Zonk, Sy, Cruxador, Iceland, Torgoni, Malakal, Fungalreason, AN_, Maerlande, Earcaraxe, Eustachy, Yakri, PyroICF, Kate Micucci, EAlb, various anons, and anyone else I've forgotten.

What is the purpose of this mod?    
The mod's purpose is a general "gameplay improvement mod." This primarily involves increasing gameplay variety. While balance is involved in this, it is not the only consideration.  The changes to the generic section can be quite conservative, but certain nations with severe underlying flaws, such as LA Pythium (coming soon!), receive comprehensive rebuilds.

#### General Changes

##### Scales:  
Growth/Death: Income 3%->2% per scale

Ohlmann - both excellent in short term gold, and excellent in long term gold. Production is a bit weak, because it don't give much money and resources become weaker quite fast. I also think that sloth 3 is not punitive enough

Maerlande -  I think growth is too obvious if you want money. If I remember correctly, Calahan used +2% for growth and gave production the other percent in his version of CBM for serious competition. I think that makes quite a difference to put a bit more decision between these two. Right now, I find growth is almost always a better choice.

sum1won: I?m including this discussion since I expect this is the biggest change in the mod.  I?d also note that I modeled income and total gold from growth and order, and the comparison suggests that growth is significantly better over the long term, and nearly as good over the short term.  The largest difference in gold is around turn 8-15 (varies depending on how aggressive expansion is) and never really rises above ~5% of income/total gold.  Largest difference I saw was a few hundred gold.
